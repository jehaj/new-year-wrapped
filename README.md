# New Year Wrapped
Submit your top songs this year and compete with your friends on who knows each others music taste the best.

## Implementation Details

Very simple implementation keeping most on the server. Uses the GoTH stack (Go, Templ, HTMX). Other than Go, HTMX and SQLite will be used.

## Features

- Advent Theme by having each theme behind a door.
- "Musical Imposter", the person whose taste most confused the group i.e. got the most incorrect guesses.
- Supports multiple parties.
- Each party can have as many people as they want.
- Each person should add their top three songs this year.
- Round-based: we go through 5 songs in a round. After the round the owners of the songs will be revealed, a winner for that round will be shown, and the overall leaderboard updated.
- There should be some kind of admin page that can be connected to the TV that shows the leaderboard, which people has guessed and other stuff.
